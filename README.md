# Modal
Javascript mini project

In the course of learning JavaScript, part of the projects was making a modal that would only appear when a button was clicked. 

After watching a video from freecodecamp I guess, I decided to recreate the modal.

When the button for the modal is clicked, an event is fired which toggles the display of the modal.
